        "* **IPython Notebook**: An IPython notebook is a webpage that mixes together text descriptions with runnable code. The webpage you are looking at right now is an IPython notebook. IPython notebooks load in your web browser, but they run all your code on a PYthon server. That server can be launched locally (i.e., on your laptop), or it can be hosted by a company like Google Cloud.\n",

        "## How to use Google Colab\n",
        "\n",
        "_Google Colab_ is an online platform that allows you to write, run, and share Python code without the need for any setup or installation. With Colab, you can launch an _IPython Notebook_ (see glossary above) on Google's cloud infrastructure.\n",
        "You have the option to launch your Colab with access to an _accelerator_ (the computer hardware that allows language models to run fast). This makes it an excellent tool for learning and experimenting with Python programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you are new to Google Colab, consider taking a look through the following FAQ:\n",
        "\n",
        "**What is a cell?** <br>\n",
        "The Colab interface consists of cells, which can be either code cells or text cells. Code cells allow you to write and execute Python code, while text cells are used for documentation and explanations. You can add new cells using the \"+\" button in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How do I run a code cell?** <br>\n",
        "To run the code in a cell, you have a few options:<br>\n",
        "  * Click the \"play\" button on the left side of the cell.\n",
        "  * Use the keyboard shortcut Shift + Enter.\n",
        "  * Go to the \"Runtime\" menu and select \"Run cell.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Once you press run, Colab will execute the code and display the output below the cell. If the code produces any output or results, it will be printed in the output area. Some code blocks may take several seconds to run.\n",
        "\n",
        "**What does it mean to restart the runtime** <br>\n",
        "Sometimes, you may encounter issues with your code where intstalled packages may not show up when imported. In such cases, you can restart the runtime. To restart the runtime, go to the \"Runtime\" menu and select \"Restart runtime.\" All local variables will be lost, so you would have to run the cells you need again.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How do I use a hardware accelerator and why would I want to?**<br>\n",
        "Some tasks require more compute power than others.\n",
        "For example, if you want to generate text with GPT-3, you send a reqest to OpenAI's servers, and all the hard work of running the model is done on OpenAI's server.\n",
        "In this case, you don't need your Colab runtime to be very powerful.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, if you want to to generation with an open-source model, you will need your Colab runtime to be powerful enough to load and run the model. In this case, you'll need to change you runetime type to give it an accelerator.\n",
        "\n",
        "To change your runtime type, click on the \"Runtime\" menu at the top of the screen and select \"Change runtime type\". In the dialog box, you can choose a hardware accelerator for your runtime. Colab provides options for \"None\" (default), \"GPU,\" or \"TPU\" (Tensor Processing Unit).\n",
        "  * If you select \"None,\" your code will run on a CPU (Central Processing Unit). This is sufficient for most purposes.\n",
        "  * If you choose \"GPU,\" Colab will allocate a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) accelerator for your runtime, which will significantly speed up the computations necessary to run a langauge model locally in your Colab.\n",
        "  * If you opt for \"TPU,\" Colab will provide access to a TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) accelerator , which is specialized hardware designed to accelerate machine learning tasks.\n",
